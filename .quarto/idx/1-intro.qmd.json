Some of the time in the lecture will be used to create a dataset for use during the course. It also gives an opportunity to review some of the things about R and statistics that it is very useful to already know.\n\nThe lecture includes:\n\n* Goals of the course\n* Course organisation\n* AI and the course\n* Making a course dataset\n* Using RStudio\n* Reviewing what you should already know\n* Learning objectives\n\n\n## Notation and some definitions\n\nThroughout the course, we will use the following notation:\n\n* $x$ for a variable. Typically this variable contains a set of observations. These observations are said to represent a sample of all the possible observations that could be made of a *population*.\n* $x_1, x_2, \\ldots$ for the values of a variable\n* $x_i$ for the $i$th value of a scalar variable. This is often spoken as \"x sub i\" or the \"i-th value of x\".\n* $x^{(1)}$ for variable 1, $x^{(2)}$ for variable 2, etc.\n* The mean of the sample $x$ is $\\bar{x}$. This is usually spoken as \"x-bar\".\n* The mean of $x$ is calculated as $\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$.\n* $n$ is the number of observations in a sample.\n* The summation symbol $\\sum$ is used to indicate that the values of $x$ are summed over all values of $i$ from 1 to $n$.\n* The standard deviation of the sample is $s$. The standard deviation of the population is $\\sigma$.\n* The variance is $s^2$. The variance of the population is $\\sigma^2$.\n* The variance of the sample is calculated as $s^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^2$.\n* The standard deviation of the sample is calculated as $s = \\sqrt{s^2}$.\n* $y$ is usually used to represent a dependent / response variable.\n* $x$ is usually used to represent an independent / predictor / explanatory variable.\n* $\\beta_0$ is usually used to denote the intercept of a linear model.\n* $\\beta_1$, $\\beta_2$, etc. are usually used to denote the coefficients of the independent variables in a linear model.\n* Estimates are denoted with a hat, so $\\hat{\\beta}_0$ is the estimate of the intercept of a linear model.\n* Hence, the estimated value of $y_i$ in a linear regression model is $\\hat{y_i} = \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 x_i^{(1)}$.\n* $e_i$ is the residual for the $i$th observation in a linear model. The residual is the difference between the observed value of $y_i$ and the predicted value of $y_i$ ($\\hat{y_i}$).\n* Often we assume errors are normally distributed with mean 0 and variance $\\sigma^2$. This is written as $e_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)$.\n* SST is the total sum of squares. It is the sum of the squared differences between the observed values of $y$ and the mean of $y$. It is calculated as $\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\bar{y})^2$.\n* SSM is the model sum of squares. It is the sum of the squared differences between the predicted values of $y$ and the mean of $y$. It is calculated as $\\sum_{i=1}^n (\\hat{y_i} - \\bar{y})^2$.\n* SSE is the error sum of squares. It is the sum of the squared differences between the observed values of $y$ and the predicted values of $y$. It is calculated as $\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2$.\n* The variance of $x$ can be written as $Var(x)$. The covariance between $x$ and $y$ can be written as $Cov(x, y)$.\n* Covariance is calculated as $Cov(x, y) = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})$.\n* $H_0$ is the null hypothesis.\n* $\\alpha$ is the significance level.\n* $df$ is the degrees of freedom.\n* $p$ is the p-value.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":5,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"center","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"1-intro.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
