# Preface {.unnumbered}


This book contains the content of the course BIO144 Data Analysis in Biology at the University of Zurich. It is intended to be used as a companion to the lectures and practical exercises of the course. All of the required content of the course (i.e., what could be in the final exam) is included in this book. Additional content is included for those who want to learn more.

Beware that Owen sometimes makes updates to the book during the semester, so the version you have may not exactly match the lectures you attend. However, all of the required content will be the same, and any changes will be correcting typos or improving explanations.

If you'd like a copy of this book for yourself, there are a few ways. But beware: if you take a local copy then it will not be updated when Owen makes changes to the online version!
